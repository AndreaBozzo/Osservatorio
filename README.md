## 🎯 What is Osservatorio?

**Osservatorio** is a platform for accessing and analyzing Italian statistical data from ISTAT.
The project provides modern REST APIs to query over 500 statistical datasets with scalable architecture.
Our goal is to unify multiple italian sources, allowing analysts, data scientist and anyone else to utilize them with ease
and on the same platform.
